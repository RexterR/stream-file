	Long: `fileServer searchs all file/s in the input directory to concurrently upload them to scyllaDB.
It was a project to get familiarize with gRPC streams and scyllaDB.fileServer takes two config --flag. For example:

If the fileServer server is not running on localhost:1500 you can change it with
	fileServer --addr localhost:8080

You can change the concurrency with 
	fileServer --workerCount 6
Higher workerCount means higher concurrency
The default value is 6.`,
