It is using golang's <em>concurrency primitives</em> for multi-upload, gRPC stream to uplaod <em>chunck-data of blob</em> to server and stores the uploaded files in <b>ScyllaDB</b>, which is a <em>distributed real-time big-data Database</em>.

## Installation
- `git clone git@github.com:sourikghosh/go-grpc-streaming-scylla.git`

```bash
~
ðŸš€ fileServer
fileServer searchs all file/s in the input directory to concurrently upload them to scyllaDB.
It was a project to get familiarize with gRPC streams and scyllaDB.fileServer takes two config --flag. For example:

If the fileServer server is not running on localhost:1500 you can change it with
        fileServer --addr localhost:8080

You can change the concurrency with
        fileServer --workerCount 6
Higher workerCount means higher concurrency
The default value is 6.

  fileServer [command]

Available Commands:
  completion  generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  help        Help about any command
  upload      uplaods all file/s concurrently to scyllaDB
